Bejeweled -- By Neil Barot
My game is the standard bejeweled game where you match up gems by moving them (only one space) to get points. There are levels in classic mode, there is Zen mode where you are free to play as long as you want at your own pace, there is blitz mode where you have 60 seconds to get as many points as possible, and everytime you get a pair, your time goes up a little bit, and there is butterfly mode. Butterfly mode is basically where the game plays as normal but butterflies spawn every move at the bottom. They act as normal pieces (other than looks), except that they MUST be cleared before they reach the top. Each move, they move up one space. 

The controls are simple. You start at a splash screen and just click on a mode, and the game takes you there. The timer starts and you just click on gems to switch them. Only gems adjacent to each other(not diagonal) can be switched. 

Some interesting things:
Animations! These took quite a long time because I had to do each frame for the swapping animation. 
Models! The game models also took a VERY long time to find. A lot of them (butterfly pieces etc) had to be made on their own, and all of the models had to be resized and converted into gif manually (because of tkinter's requirements).
There are some little things here and there that I added, like bringing the screen to the front, changing the window's title, etc. 
I considered using modules such as pygame, but decided to just stick with tkinter, which made things much faster.
